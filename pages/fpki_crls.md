This section will provide you with a brief overview of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and downloadable links to the commonly requested Federal PKI artifacts.

### Certificate Revocation Lists ###
Various events can occur that require a certificate (or a set of certificates) to no longer be trusted.  When those events occur, the certificate needs to be revoked and Relying Parties notified,  Examples of such events include:

- Lost, stolen, damaged, or misused certificate.  
- Compliance issues with or a security breach of the Certification Authority that issued the certificate.  
- Termination of employment of certificate holder.
- Certificate holder switches to a different job role (e.g., switching from Role A to Role B, and the certificate is designated for use only by Role A), 
- Certification Authority that issued the certificate terminates its relationship with the Federal PKI.

> In technical terms, *a certificate should be revoked when the binding between the subject and the subjectâ€™s public key defined within a certificate is no longer considered valid*.

To notify Relying Parties of revoked certificates, CAs publish Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), which are simple lists of certificates that have been revoked and should no longer be relied upon.  

> Relying Parties Parties should obtain CRLs on an ongoing basis and process them accordingly. CAs publish CRLs on a regular schedule and on an emergency basis - as specified by applicable certificate policy.

> To help Relying Parties find CRLs, CAs make public both a description of how to obtain revocation information for the certificates they publish and an explanation of the consequences of using out of date revocation information.
